# Tailwind Sandbox

This is part of the Tailwind From Scratch course on Udemy. The sandbox contains around 20 different folders/files that focus on specific aspects/classes of Tailwind.

tailwind-sandbox is my folder which I used to follow the course along by coping the starter folder. tailwind-sandbox-starter is the original folder with the empty html files and the tailwind-sandbox-done folder is the finished ccode.

We are just using the Play CDN for this part of the course.
